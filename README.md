# odin-recipes

- This project is all about making a website for Food Recipes (from TheOdinProject).
- I made it by using onle `html` (no CSS no JS)
- It got a homepage where all recipes pages' links are there to check.
- You can check the live site on: https://tonystark-47.github.io/odin-recipes/

##Happy Coding !!!
