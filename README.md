# odin-recipes

- This project is all about making a website of Food Recipes (TheOdinProject Assignment).
- I made it by using `html` only (no CSS no JS).
- It got a homepage where all recipes are listed and each recipe got their own page.
- You can check the live site on: https://tonystark-47.github.io/odin-recipes/

## Happy Coding !!!
